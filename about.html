        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        <p class="p2"> Greetings, I am Ninah Cymone Fuller. I am born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia. I am a senior at Kennesaw State University, where I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in cybersecurity. I attended technologically oriented schools throughout my academic career, which sparked my interest in computer science. In addition, I took part in a summer research program at Georgia Tech where I researched deep neural network adversarial attacks. My enthusiasm for network security has been cemented by this encounter. <br>

          Outside of academics, I am passionate about travel, music and sports. I participated in multiple recitals and competitions over my six years of playing the clarinet in middle and high school. Also, before I was sixteen, I had visited several different nations. In addition, I've developed a fresh passion for sports viewing. I enjoy watching basketball, baseball, and football, but all I did was cheer and dance.<br>
          
          My objective is to earn a Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity from Kennesaw State University. I wish to obtain my CySA+ credential and further my network security education given my expertise in cybersecurity.
          </p>
