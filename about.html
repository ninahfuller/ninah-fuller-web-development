        <h1>About</h1>
        <p class="p1">Hello, My name is Ninah Fuller. I am born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia. I am a senior at Kennesaw State University, where I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in cybersecurity. I attended technologically oriented schools throughout my academic career, which sparked my interest in computer science. In addition, I took part in a summer research program at Georgia Tech where I researched deep neural network adversarial attacks. My enthusiasm for network security has been cemented by this encounter.
